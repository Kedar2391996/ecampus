National Cadet Corps (N.C.C.)
 
 

The origin of NCC can be traced back to the 'University Corps' , which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917 ,
 with the object to make up the shortages of the Army. During the Independence movement, the leaders of our nation had
  realised the need to create a national level youth organisation, to train and groom young boys as responsible citizens
   and future leaders of our great country in all walks of life. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organisation ,
    comprising Army, Navy and Air Force, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens.
     In 1920 , when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the 'University Corps' was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC).
      The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. It was a significant step towards the Indianisation of the Armed Forces.
       In 1942 , the UTC was re-christened as the 'University Officers Training Corps' . 
The National Cadet Corps came into existence on 15 th July 1948 under the NCC Act XXXI of 1948 under the Ministry of Defence. During the Independence movement,
 leaders of our nation had realised need to create a national level youth organisation, to train and groom young boys as responsible citizens and future leaders
  of our great country in all walks of life, including the defence forces. Consequently, a committee under Shri HN Kunzru was set up in 1946 under the directives
   of the first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, to consider the establishment of a nationwide cadet corps, which was born through the Act of Parliament on 15th July 1948 . The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru presided over the function of raising the first NCC Unit at Delhi on the last Sunday of Nov 1948 . This day is traditionally celebrated as the 'NCC Day'.
